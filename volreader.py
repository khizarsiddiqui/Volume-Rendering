# first commit
# some of the topics covered in this project:
# • Using GLSL for GPU computations
# • Creating vertex and fragment shaders
# • Representing 3D volumetric data and using the volume ray casting algorithm
# • Using numpy arrays for 3D transformation matrices

# There are various ways to render a 3D data set. In this project, you’ll use the volume ray casting method, 
# which is an image-based rendering technique used to generate the final image from the 2D slice, pixel by pixel.
